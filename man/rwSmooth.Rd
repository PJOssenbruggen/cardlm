\usage{
rwSmooth(tdf1df2, veh, dV, dW, m0, C0, tend, frequency)
}
\arguments{
\item{veh, }{vehicle number.}

\item{dV, }{variance of the observation noise.}

\item{dW, }{diagonal elements of the variance matrix of the system noise.}

\item{m0, }{the expected value of the pre-sample state vector.}

\item{C0, }{the variance matrix of the pre-sample state vector.}

\item{tend, }{end time in seconds}

\item{frequency, }{number of time-steps per second}

\item{tdf1fd2, }{observations from \code{cartools}, a matrix.}

\item{wv}{signal noise ratio, a number}
}
\value{
A \code{ts} plot to study the effects of \code{dW} on the forecast.
}
\description{
All observations are in units of feet and seconds.
